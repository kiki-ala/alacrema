## alacrema

> `alacrema` (as in 'à la carte', but *espresso crema*)  

effectively, this is the start of my attempt to prove a possible method for making a terminal multiplexer within `anathema`.  

it also can be useful for making a shell.

i have ideas but just sharing this demo for now.

more work will come around, as long as the world is nice!
